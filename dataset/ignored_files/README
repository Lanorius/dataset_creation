script_01:
Takes the current version of the bindingDB_all.tsv and extracts the columns of interest for DTI analysis into a separate file
Updates are paused since the following steps will be part of the evalutaion phase, and will be done on a different subset that I am working on currently
Planned update: Instead of creating a separate slimed down file it will create:
	a fasta file using the sequence and the Swissprot ID
	a SMILE file using the smile and PubCHEM CID
	an interaction file using the same IDs as the two before
	
script_02: 
To create Kiba scores you require ic50 scores and either Ki or Kd values. This script checks how many rows from bindingDB fullfill that requirement.
