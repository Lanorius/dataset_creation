script_01:
Takes the current version of the bindingDB_all.tsv and extracts the columns of interest for DTI analysis into a separate file
Planned update: Instead of creating a separate slimed down file it will create:
	a fasta file using the sequence and the Swissprot ID
	a SMILE file using the smile and PubCHEM CID
	an interaction file using the same IDs as the two before
