script_01: (This was just an idea to get started)
Takes the current version of the bindingDB_all.tsv and extracts the columns of interest for DTI analysis into a separate file
	
script_02: (Not enough values for Kiba scores)
To create Kiba scores you require ic50 scores and either Ki or Kd values. This script checks how many rows from bindingDB fullfill that requirement.

script_03: 
Creating plots of the valeus within bindingDB_All.tsv
